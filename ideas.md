Build a Cloudera DataFlow to ingest weather data into Apache Iceberg

Source: Retrieve weather data from an external source, such as a weather API or a weather database.
Transform: Convert the weather data into the desired format (e.g. Avro, Parquet) using a tool such as Apache NiFi or Apache Beam.
Store: Store the transformed data in Apache Iceberg, a format-agnostic data lake that provides efficient and optimized storage and retrieval of large-scale data.
Monitor: Set up monitoring and alerting to ensure the data flow is running smoothly and to detect any potential issues.
Access: Provide access to the ingested weather data for downstream processing and analysis using tools such as Apache Spark or Apache Impala.
Repeat: Continuously ingest new weather data on a regular basis to keep the data up-to-date.

Here is a high-level guide to building a Cloudera DataFlow to ingest weather data into Apache Iceberg:

Collect weather data: You can either scrape the data from a website or use an API to get the data in a structured format (e.g. CSV, JSON, etc.).

Store the data: Store the collected data in a temporary location (e.g. a local file system, Amazon S3, etc.).

Create a Cloudera DataFlow: Use the Cloudera DataFlow platform to build a data pipeline for ingesting the data. The pipeline should include the following stages:

Data ingestion: Ingest the data from the temporary location into the Cloudera DataFlow platform.
Data processing: Use Apache NiFi to process the data, such as converting it from its original format to a more optimized format (e.g. Parquet) and/or aggregating it to reduce its size.
Data sink: Use Apache Iceberg to sink the processed data into a data lake. Apache Iceberg is a storage layer for big data that provides data management and metadata management on top of distributed file systems or cloud object stores.
Monitor and optimize the pipeline: Monitor the pipeline to ensure that it is working as expected, and optimize it as needed to improve its performance and stability.

Note: This is a high-level guide, and the details of the implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your use case.
